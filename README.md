Wikipedia API wrapper for references

Background Story

I just graduated from Physiology department, Universty of Ibadan. I started typing my final year project some days before submission
deadline. I made use of Wikipedia for my literature review because each page is supported with enough references. The next task was 
to copy and paste the references. This was a lot of work considering the fact that some pages has over 200 references and I wasn't 
working with just one page. I decided to make use of Wikipedia API wrappers but all the ones I checked didn't do what I needed. So
I decided to write a simple script that scraped Wikipedia page


Tools I Used

BeautifulSoup
